This repository was created to get some practical experience in Multivriate Linear Regression and to serve as a learning example for others wishing to start their way in data science and learn about linear regression.

[Some theory on Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) - see also on [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and [Standford CS221: Artificial Intelligence course](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs221/).

Good luck on your Data Scienec Path!
